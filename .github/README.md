AzerothCore can also serve as a learning resource for aspiring developers who want to understand how WoW servers work, how MMORPGs are structured, how game server emulators are created, or to improve their C++ and SQL knowledge.

If you want to contribute to the project, you will find a lot of resources that will guide you in our [wiki](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/contribute).

You can check the [authors](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/blob/master/AUTHORS) file for more details.

> [!NOTE]  
> While I would prefer this project to be [GNU GPL v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html), to be able to shared between all the emulators under the same license, It remain under [GNU AGPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) until it gets resolved in AzerothCore, refering to this [discussion](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/discussions/19868), because I would be unable to use all the developement made from AzerothCore from 2016+

It's important to note that this project and AzerothCore are not an official Blizzard Entertainment product, and it is not affiliated with or endorsed by World of Warcraft or Blizzard Entertainment. AzerothCore does not in any case sponsor nor support illegal public servers. If you use this project to run an illegal public server and not for testing and learning it is your own personal choice.
